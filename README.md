# flower-classification

This project demonstrates a classic machine learning task of classifying flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. Implemented in Python using Scikit-learn, the project includes data preprocessing, model training (using various classifiers like (logistic regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors), evaluation, and comparison of model performance metrics. The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions.
